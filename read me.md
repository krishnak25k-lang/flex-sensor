ABOUT MY PROJECT:
      This project demonstrates real-time interaction between flex sensors and a 3D environment using Unity.
*Flex sensors detect bending and convert it into analog signals
*A Raspberry Pi Pico reads these signals and sends normalized values to Unity through serial communication.
*Unity receives the data and maps each flex sensor value to the scaling of a corresponding 3D cube.
*As the sensor is flexed, the related cube expands smoothly, and shrinks back when released.
*This system provides an intuitive visualization of sensor data for learning, rehabilitation, and interactive applications.

TOOLS:
 Hardware:
      flex ssensor,Raspberry pi pico device,10K resistor,connection wires.
 Software:
       Thonny IDE,Unity application,VS code/Visual Studio.

How Neurodiverse Persons Can Use This System:

        Neurodiverse persons, such as individuals with autism, ADHD, or sensory processing differences, can use this system as an interactive and visual feedback tool.
When they flex their fingers, the cubes in Unity expand or shrink, providing immediate visual response to their actions.This helps them understand cause-and-effect relationships in a simple and engaging way.The project can be used as a calming sensory activity, improving focus and motor coordination. It also supports hand–finger movement practice in a non-stressful, game-like environment. Overall, the system offers a safe and customizable way to enhance learning, therapy, and interaction for neurodiverse individuals.
