ABOUT MY PROJECT:
     This project uses flex sensors to interact with 3D cubes in Unity.
A Raspberry Pi Pico reads finger bend values and sends them to Unity in real time.
Each cube expands when its corresponding flex sensor is bent.
The system provides simple visual feedback for interactive and assistive applications.

Functionalities Used:
*Real-time detection of finger bending using flex sensors

*Conversion of analog sensor values into normalized digital data

*Serial data transmission from Raspberry Pi Pico to Unity

*Dynamic scaling of 3D cubes based on sensor input

*Visual feedback for user interaction and movement tracking


TOOLS:
 Hardware:
    flex ssensor,Raspberry pi pico device,10K resistor,connection wires.
 Software:
     Thonny IDE,Unity application,VS code/Visual Studio.

Methodologies:
      The project uses sensor-based data acquisition to read finger bend values from flex sensors.
Analog-to-digital conversion is performed using the Raspberry Pi Pico’s ADC pins.
Serial communication methodology is used to transfer real-time data to Unity.
Data normalization and filtering are applied for stable input values.
Unity-based real-time visualization is used to map sensor data to 3D cube scaling.

How Neurodiverse Persons Can Use This System:

  Neurodiverse persons, such as individuals with autism, ADHD, or sensory processing differences, can use this system as an interactive and visual feedback tool. 
When they flex their fingers, the cubes in Unity expand or shrink, providing immediate visual response to their actions.
This helps them understand cause-and-effect relationships in a simple and engaging way.
The project can be used as a calming sensory activity, improving focus and motor coordination.
It also supports hand–finger movement practice in a non-stressful, game-like environment.
Overall, the system offers a safe and customizable way to enhance learning, therapy, and interaction for neurodiverse individuals.
